# Recursive Functions

Welcome! In this video, we'll explore recursive functionsâ€”a powerful programming concept where a function calls itself to break down a problem into smaller, more manageable pieces.

We'll use a classic example: the factorial function. The factorial of a number 'n' is the product of all positive integers up to 'n'. A recursive function defines this in terms of itself. As you see, factorial of 'n' is defined as 'n' times factorial of 'n-1'. To prevent this from going on forever, we need a base case: factorial of 0 is 1.

Let's watch this in action by calculating the factorial of 4. First, the function `factorial(4)` is called. It can't answer directly, so it calls `factorial(3)`. This continues all the way down, with each function calling the next, until we reach our base case, `factorial(0)`.

Once the base case is hit, it returns the value 1. Now, the functions can solve themselves in reverse. `factorial(1)` receives the value 1, calculates 1 times 1, and returns 1. `factorial(2)` receives this, calculates 2 times 1, and returns 2. This process, known as unwinding, continues up the call stack until the original call, `factorial(4)`, gets the value 6 from below, calculates 4 times 6, and returns our final answer: 24.

To summarize, every recursive function has two essential components. First, the base case, which is a simple condition that stops the recursion. Second, the recursive step, where the function calls itself with an input that moves it closer to the base case. By combining these two parts, recursion can solve complex problems in a surprisingly elegant way.
