# Electric Field Lines: Positive vs Negative Charges

Let's explore how electric field lines behave around charged particles! Understanding the direction of electric field lines is crucial in physics, and we'll see how they differ between positive and negative charges.

First, let's look at a positive charge. Notice how the field lines radiate outward from the positive charge, with yellow arrows pointing away from the center. This shows that electric field lines always emerge from positive charges, spreading outward in all directions. Think of it as the positive charge "pushing" the field lines away.

Next, we see a negative charge. Here, the behavior is exactly opposite - all field lines point inward toward the negative charge, as shown by the yellow arrows. The negative charge acts like a sink, "pulling" the field lines toward it. This is a fundamental principle: electric field lines always point toward negative charges.

Finally, we combine both charges to create an electric dipole. Watch how the field lines now flow from the positive charge (top) to the negative charge (bottom). The yellow arrows show this natural flow of the electric field. Some field lines connect directly between the charges, while others extend out into space. This pattern is exactly what we expect: emerging from positive, flowing toward negative.

Remember the key principle: electric field lines always point away from positive charges and toward negative charges. This simple rule helps us understand and predict how electric fields behave in any arrangement of charges.
