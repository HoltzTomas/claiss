# Understanding Bubble Sort Algorithm

Welcome to this visualization of the Bubble Sort algorithm! Bubble Sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms that repeatedly steps through a list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they're in the wrong order.

Let's start with our unsorted array of numbers: 6, 3, 8, 2, and 5. Watch as we compare adjacent pairs of numbers. When we find a pair where the left number is larger than the right number, we swap them. This process is similar to how bubbles rise to the surface in water, hence the name "Bubble Sort."

Notice how the larger numbers gradually "bubble up" to their correct positions on the right side of the array. The yellow highlighting shows which pair of numbers we're currently comparing. When a swap is needed, watch how the numbers smoothly exchange positions through a series of movements.

After each complete pass through the array, we guarantee that at least one more number has reached its final position. That's why we need fewer comparisons in each subsequent pass. When the numbers turn green at the end, it indicates that our array is fully sorted in ascending order: 2, 3, 5, 6, 8.

While Bubble Sort isn't the most efficient sorting algorithm for large datasets, its simplicity makes it an excellent teaching tool for understanding how sorting algorithms work. The visual nature of the swapping process helps us see exactly how the algorithm makes decisions and moves elements to their correct positions.
