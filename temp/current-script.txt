# Boolean Algebra: The Mathematics of Logic

Welcome to our exploration of Boolean Algebra, the mathematical foundation of digital logic and computer science. Named after mathematician George Boole, this branch of algebra deals with variables that can only have two possible values: true or false, often represented as 1 or 0.

Let's begin by understanding the three fundamental operations in Boolean Algebra. First, we have the AND operation, represented by the symbol ∧. The AND operation only results in true (1) when both inputs are true. As we can see in the truth table, this means 1 AND 1 equals 1, while any combination involving 0 results in 0. This is similar to multiplication in regular arithmetic.

Next, we explore the OR operation, shown by the symbol ∨. The OR operation results in true (1) if at least one of the inputs is true. Looking at its truth table, we can see that only when both inputs are 0 does the result become 0. This operation is similar to addition, but with the special case that 1 OR 1 equals 1.

Finally, we have the NOT operation, denoted by the symbol ¬. This is the simplest operation as it works on a single input, simply inverting its value. When we apply NOT to 1, we get 0, and when we apply it to 0, we get 1. This operation is fundamental for creating complementary logic in digital circuits.

These three basic operations form the building blocks of all digital logic, from simple electronic circuits to complex computer processors. By combining AND, OR, and NOT operations, we can create any logical function needed in digital systems. This is why Boolean Algebra is often called the mathematics of digital logic, serving as the foundation for modern computing.
