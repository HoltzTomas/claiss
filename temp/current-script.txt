# Visualizing Electric Fields

Today, we'll be visualizing the invisible force that governs electricity: the electric field.

First, we see a single positive charge. The arrows, known as field lines, show the direction of the force that a positive test charge would experience. For a positive source, the field lines radiate outwards, showing a force of repulsion.

Next, we have a negative charge. Notice how the field lines now point inwards. This indicates that a positive test charge would be attracted towards the negative source charge. The density of the lines represents the strength of the fieldâ€”closer to the charge, the force is stronger.

Finally, let's look at an electric dipole, which consists of a positive and a negative charge separated by a distance. The field lines originate from the positive charge and terminate on the negative charge, creating a distinct, curved pattern. This combined field is fundamental to understanding everything from molecules to antennas.

Electric fields are a powerful concept, providing a map of the electrostatic forces that are fundamental to physics and engineering.
