# Bubble Sort Algorithm Explained

Welcome to an animated explanation of the Bubble Sort algorithm! Bubble Sort is a simple yet fundamental sorting technique that helps us understand how sorting works behind the scenes.

In this animation, we start with an unsorted array of numbers: 5, 2, 8, 12, 1, and 6. Watch carefully as the algorithm compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. Notice how in each pass, the largest unsorted element "bubbles up" to its correct position at the end of the array.

The magic of Bubble Sort happens through repeated comparisons. In each iteration, it compares neighboring elements and swaps them if they are out of order. Think of it like sorting a stack of cards by repeatedly comparing and rearranging them. By the end of the process, our array transforms from a random collection of numbers into a perfectly sorted sequence, demonstrating how even a simple algorithm can bring order to chaos!
