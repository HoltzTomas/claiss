# Claiss Roadmap üó∫Ô∏è

This document outlines the current state of Claiss and our vision for future development.

## üìç Current State (v0.1.0 - MVP)

The current version is a **Minimum Viable Product** focused on core functionality:

### ‚úÖ Implemented Features
- AI-powered scene generation using Google Gemini
- Scene-based video editing workflow
- Manim compilation via Modal.com serverless infrastructure
